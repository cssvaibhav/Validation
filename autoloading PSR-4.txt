Autoloading in PSR-4 and using Composer : 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Suppose you have direcotry structure as follows-
   <root>
   |- composer.json
   |- index.php
   |- src
   	  |- logger
   	  	 |- Logger.php
   	  |- email
   	  	 |- Email.php

2. In index.php file, you need inlcude statement as -
	require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

3. In same page you can create object of Logger class i.e. Logger.php / Email Class i.e. Email.php as follows-
	$obj = new logger\Logger.php Or
	$obj = new email\Email.php

   And use their method to show output

   $obj->info();

4. Now create composer.json file if it is not there, or edit it as follows.
	{
	    "autoload": {
	        "psr-4": {"": "src/"}
	    }
	}

	Here we are telling composer to autoload the files with PSR-4 standards.
	And we are telling composer that our package files are stored in src folders as written in composer.json file.

5. Now open terminal and goto your projects root folder and type following command

	<project>$ composer dump_autoload

   This command will create autoload.php file in vendor folder which will be responsible for autoloading particular class whenever we directly use the class without including them.
   e.g. as shown in index.php we are not including logger\Logger.php or email\Email.php file. We are directly using it. So, the first line which we have written in index.php i.e. "require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';" will be responsible for loading appropriate file whenever we require it.
